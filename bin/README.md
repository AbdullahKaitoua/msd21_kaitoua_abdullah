# Hangmen
>Hangman is a words guessing game for one player.
The computer guesses a word and the user has to suggest letters one by one. 
Every time the word contains a letter, the computer opens it (all of them, if there are a few). Every time the word doesn't contain a letter, the computer gives a penalty point for the user. 
If there are five penalty points, the user looses. 
If there are no hidden letters anymore, the computer looses.
 
## Installation

Hangmen requires [JAVA](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to run the game.

```bash
javac hangmen.java
```

## Usage

in the program you can add as many words as you wish in the input file and the program will pick a word in a random order from the file when you start playing.
