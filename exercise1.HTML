<p>All men have <strong>stars</strong>, but they are not the same things
for different people.</p>
<p>For some, who are travelers, the <strong>stars</strong> are
guides.</p>
<p>For others they are no more than little lights in the sky.</p>
<p>For others, who are scholars, they are problems…</p>
<p>But all these <strong>stars</strong> are silent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You-You alone will have <strong>stars</strong> as no one else has
them.</p>

<p>“It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is
essential is <em>invisible</em> to the eye.”</p>
<p>“What makes the desert beautiful,′ said the little prince, ’is that
somewhere it hides a well…”</p>
<h2 id="what-matters-most">What matters most</h2>
<p>What matters most are the simple pleasures so abundant that we can
all enjoy them…</p>
<p>Happiness doesn’t lie in the objects we gather around us. To find it,
all we need to do is open our eyes.”</p>
