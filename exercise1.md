## Stars
All men have **stars**, but they are not the same things for different people.

For some, who are travelers, the **stars** are guides.

For others they are no more than little lights in the sky.

For others, who are scholars, they are problems... 

But all these **stars** are silent.

>You-You alone will have **stars** as no one else has them.

## Best Quote
"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is _invisible_ to the eye.”

“What makes the desert beautiful,′ said the little prince, ‘is that somewhere it hides a well...”

## What matters most

What matters most are the simple pleasures so abundant that we can all enjoy them...

Happiness doesn’t lie in the objects we gather around us. To find it, all we need to do is open our eyes.”
